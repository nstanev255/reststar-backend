# RestStar server
RestStar is an open source entertainment rating/ranking platform, written to solve some of the issues I have with the mainstream platforms.

The RestStar Server, as the name suggests, is the backend solution for the platform.

# Resources
The resources that power the whole platform are taken from numerous APIs.

Some of which :
- [Jikan](https://github.com/jikan-me/jikan) :  Unofficial MyAnimeList api. Used in on order to provide anime rating/ranking functionality.
- [MangaDex](https://api.mangadex.org/docs/) : Manga Reader API. Used in order to provide manga rating/ranking functionality.
